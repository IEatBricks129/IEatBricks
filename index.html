            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Kaiden, and I enjoy building computers and just learning how things work in general.</p>
            <p>I'm passionate about computer hardware, learning web development, and photography and enjoy creating small sites (such as this) for fun, experimenting with my writing abilities, and learning new technologies. i specifically enjoy compiling theorys on games such as undertale/deltarune and writing them into a giant sort of essay.</p>
            <p>In my "work", I focus on creating user-friendly yet nice looking sites (soon to be this one), as well as solving complex problems in creating said sites.</p>
            <p>Feel free to connect with me, my discord username is ithrowbricksatinfants.</p>
