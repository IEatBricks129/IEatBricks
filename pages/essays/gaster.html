            <p class="intro-paragraph">
                The Echoes of the Void: W.D. Gaster's Interdimensional Influence in Deltarune
            </p>
            <h3>I. Introduction: The Shadow of the Royal Scientist</h3>
            <p>
                W.D. Gaster stands as one of the most enigmatic figures within Toby Fox's interconnected universes of <em>Undertale</em> and <em>Deltarune</em>. Initially introduced in <em>Undertale</em> as the former Royal Scientist of the Underground, his existence is shrouded in mystery, marked by a catastrophic event that led to his "shattering across time and space". He is not a character encountered through normal gameplay, but rather through rare, cryptic events often triggered by hidden "Fun Value" parameters or by direct modification of game files. His presence is primarily alluded to through the fragmented dialogue of "Gaster Followers" and obscure data within the game's code.
            </p>
            <p>
                In stark contrast to his elusive nature in <em>Undertale</em>, Gaster's influence in <em>Deltarune</em>, a "spiritual successor" set in a parallel universe, appears far more overt and foundational. His presence is woven into the very fabric of <em>Deltarune</em>'s meta-narrative, its character interactions, and even its core mechanics from the outset. This report aims to synthesize the existing lore and various fan interpretations into a comprehensive theoretical framework regarding Gaster's connections and broader implications. The analysis will move beyond simple observation, offering an interpretive understanding of his complex narrative function within both games.
            </p>
            <h3>II. Gaster's Canonical Footprint in Undertale</h3>
            <h4>His Identity as the Former Royal Scientist and Mysterious Disappearance</h4>
            <p>
                W.D. Gaster was a figure of immense brilliance, serving as the Royal Scientist for the Underground kingdom before Alphys assumed the role. His most notable creation was the CORE, the geothermal energy plant powering the monster civilization. However, his tenure was abruptly cut short by a calamitous event: he "vanished without a trace", "fell into his creation" (widely believed to be the CORE), or suffered from "experiments gone wrong". The most consistent description of his fate is that he was "shattered across time and space". This catastrophic incident led to his erasure from the collective memory of most characters, rendering him largely forgotten.
            </p>
            <h4>Analysis of Hidden Content</h4>
            <p>
                Gaster's presence in <em>Undertale</em> is primarily manifested through a series of hidden, conditional events and data fragments:
            </p>
            <p><strong>Entry Number 17</strong>: This pivotal text, accessible only through specific "Fun Value" triggers or file manipulation, is written in Wingdings, a font strongly associated with Gaster. The content of this entry is highly suggestive: "DARK, DARKER, YET DARKER. THE DARKNESS KEEPS GROWING. THE SHADOWS CUTTING DEEPER. PHOTON READINGS NEGATIVE. THIS NEXT EXPERIMENT. SEEMS. VERY. VERY. INTERESTING. WHAT DO YOU TWO THINK?".
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    * ENTRY NUMBER 17<br>
                    * DARK, DARKER, YET DARKER.<br>
                    * THE DARKNESS KEEPS GROWING.<br>
                    * THE SHADOWS CUT DEEPER.<br>
                    * PHOTON READINGS NEGATIVE.<br>
                    * THIS NEXT EXPERIMENT.<br>
                    * SEEMS VERY, VERY INTERESTING…<br>
                    * WHAT DO YOU TWO THINK?
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                The repeated emphasis on "darkness" and "negative photon readings" in Entry Number 17 establishes a strong thematic and potentially causal link to the Dark Worlds of <em>Deltarune</em>. Ralsei's explanation in <em>Deltarune</em> that Dark Worlds form when light levels become "darker than dark" directly echoes Gaster's words, suggesting that Gaster's experiment was either directly related to the genesis of these dimensions or laid the fundamental groundwork for their existence. This connection implies Gaster is not merely a victim of a past accident but an active, albeit unseen, force shaping the <em>Deltarune</em> universe.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Gaster Followers</strong>: These peculiar, greyed-out non-player characters (NPCs) appear only when specific "Fun Values" are met. Their dialogue revolves around Gaster's story, recounting his mysterious disappearance and shattered existence. Notably, one follower is depicted holding a "piece of him," which strongly resembles the "Mystery Man" sprite, a figure widely believed to be Gaster himself. These followers, along with the "Mystery Man" sprite, visually represent Gaster's fragmented and erased existence through their monochromatic appearance and tendency to vanish after speaking. Their ability to convey information about Gaster, despite his general forgotten status, suggests a residual awareness or echo of his presence embedded within the game's underlying code or reality itself, rather than a complete and utter erasure. This reinforces the idea that Gaster's influence persists even without physical manifestation, operating on a meta-level within the game's reality.
            </p>
            <p><strong>"Fun Value" Mechanics and Rare Events</strong>: The "Fun Value" system, a hidden numerical variable randomly assigned at the start of each new game, dictates the player's chances of encountering Gaster-related events. These events include encounters with Gaster Followers, access to a secret "Sound Test" room containing "Gaster's Theme", and a mysterious phone call where a voice abruptly cuts off after asking "Can I speak to G...". The very nature of this system, requiring either luck or direct manipulation of game files to uncover Gaster's secrets, blurs the line between player agency and the game's predetermined "fate". This mechanic positions Gaster as a "secret" character existing outside the normal flow of gameplay. The act of discovering him often necessitates interacting with the game's underlying code, suggesting Gaster exists on a meta-level, aware of the game's structure and the player's interaction with it. This foundational concept sets the stage for <em>Deltarune</em>'s explicit meta-commentary on player control and agency.
            </p>
            <h4>Implied Connections to Sans and Papyrus</h4>
            <p>
                The lore of <em>Undertale</em> contains several compelling, albeit indirect, connections between Gaster and the skeleton brothers, Sans and Papyrus:
            </p>
            <p><strong>Linguistic and Thematic Ties</strong>: Sans and Papyrus are famously named after fonts (Comic Sans and Papyrus, respectively). This parallels Gaster's own name, which is widely associated with the Wingdings font, the typeface used in Entry Number 17. This shared naming convention suggests a deep, possibly familial or experimental, relationship.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Gaster Blasters</strong>: Sans, a powerful and mysterious character, wields unique skeletal weapons known as "Gaster Blasters" during combat. The explicit naming of these weapons after Gaster strongly implies a direct connection between Sans and the former Royal Scientist, perhaps indicating that Sans was either involved in Gaster's experiments or inherited/created these weapons based on Gaster's designs.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Sans's Secret Workshop</strong>: Behind Sans and Papyrus's house lies a hidden workshop, accessible only through specific conditions in a True Pacifist run. Inside, a "strange machine" is concealed behind a curtain, along with blueprints written in "Strange Symbols" (believed to be Wingdings). A drawer also contains a photograph of Sans with "some other people you don't recognise" and the cryptic words "don't forget". These elements are not mere coincidences but deliberate thematic and narrative connections. The "don't forget" message implies that Gaster's erasure from memory was a significant event, and Sans, uniquely among the characters, retains some awareness or memory of him. This could mean Sans was directly involved in or profoundly affected by Gaster's accident, or is actively attempting to counteract the memory erasure, perhaps even striving to restore Gaster through the "strange machine." This deepens Sans's mysterious nature and hints at a larger, hidden history that ties directly into Gaster's past.
            </p>
            <h3>III. Gaster's Pervasive Influence in Deltarune: A Web of Clues</h3>
            <p>
                In <em>Deltarune</em>, Gaster's influence shifts from being a hidden secret to a pervasive, almost omnipresent force, subtly shaping the narrative and the player's experience.
            </p>
            <h4>The "Goner Maker" Introduction</h4>
            <p>
                The very beginning of <em>Deltarune</em> serves as a profound introduction to Gaster's direct involvement:
            </p>
            <p><strong>The Mysterious Voice and its Speaking Style</strong>: The game opens with a disembodied voice addressing the player directly, speaking in an all-caps, no-contraction style with occasional mid-sentence pauses. This distinct speech pattern is identical to Gaster's known communication style from <em>Undertale</em> and is further reinforced by the voice's internal "typer value" of 666 in the game files. This numerical association, linked to Gaster's unused stats in <em>Undertale</em>, immediately brands him as a powerful, potentially ominous, and controlling force over the player's experience. By directly addressing the player and guiding the initial "vessel" creation, Gaster positions himself as an overarching entity controlling the game's initial parameters. This immediately establishes a meta-narrative where the player's agency is questioned, and Gaster's influence is paramount, setting the stage for the themes of choice and control that permeate <em>Deltarune</em>.
            </p>
            <p><strong>The Discarded Vessel and its "Goner" Labeling</strong>: During this introductory sequence, the player is prompted to create a "vessel" by choosing various body parts. However, this created form is abruptly discarded by a second voice, which declares, "No one can choose who they are in this world". This entire scene is internally coded as "GONER MAKER" in the game files, and the vessel's individual sprites are explicitly labeled "GONER". This sequence profoundly establishes the player's lack of true agency in <em>Deltarune</em> from the outset. The "Goner" label connects to Gaster's "Goner Kid" NPC in <em>Undertale</em>, who discusses hypothetical worlds where the player does not exist. The immediate discard of the player's creation implies that the player's initial choice is ultimately meaningless within the game's predetermined framework. This suggests that Gaster is experimenting not just with the game's world, but with the player's interaction and "Determination," perhaps seeking a "vessel" that can withstand or be manipulated by his influence, linking back to his past experiments with determination in <em>Undertale</em>. The "Goner Maker" sequence can be interpreted as Gaster's attempt to create a perfect conduit for his influence, or perhaps to understand the fundamental nature of existence and non-existence within his own fragmented state.
            </p>
            <p><strong>The "ANOTHER HIM" Soundtrack</strong>: The musical piece accompanying the vessel creation sequence is titled "ANOTHER HIM". This track shares a distinct leitmotif with "Gaster's Theme" from <em>Undertale</em> (internally named mus_st_him). The title "ANOTHER HIM" strongly suggests Gaster is attempting to manifest himself or a new form. This could imply he is trying to create a new "him" to inhabit, or that the discarded vessel itself is "another him" in a fragmented sense, reinforcing the idea of his scattered existence and ongoing attempts to coalesce or re-establish a presence. If Gaster is "shattered across time and space", then "ANOTHER HIM" could refer to a new attempt at physical manifestation or a new "vessel" for himself, aligning with theories that Gaster is trying to re-manifest or operate within the game's reality.
            </p>
            <h4>Cryptic Communications and Meta-Narrative</h4>
            <p>
                Gaster's influence extends beyond the game's internal narrative, permeating its very presentation and marketing:
            </p>
            <p><strong>Toby Fox's Pre-Release Tweets and Website Hints</strong>: Prior to <em>Deltarune</em>'s official release, Toby Fox's official Twitter account posted cryptic messages adopting Gaster's distinctive speaking style—all caps, specific spacing, and repetition of words like "VERY, VERY, INTERESTING". Furthermore, the official Deltarune website initially featured a him.png image displaying Wingdings text directly quoting Entry Number 17 ("THIS NEXT EXPERIMENT SEEMS VERY VERY INTERESTING"). This image was later updated to include text referencing Ralsei's prophecy ("THREE HEROES APPEARED TO BANISH THE ANGELS HEAVEN"). Toby Fox's deliberate use of Gaster's voice and text on official channels blurs the line between developer and character, suggesting Gaster is a meta-narrative construct directly communicating with the player outside the game. This implies that Gaster's influence extends beyond the game's internal logic, into the very marketing and anticipation of the game itself, positioning <em>Deltarune</em> as an "experiment" being conducted by Gaster, with the player as a participant.
            </p>
            <p><strong>The "Man Behind the Tree" and the Recurring "Egg" Mystery</strong>: A mysterious, cloaked figure, widely theorized to be Gaster, appears in secret, hard-to-find rooms across <em>Deltarune</em>'s chapters. This figure consistently offers the player an "Egg". The egg's description is notably ambiguous: "Not too important, not too unimportant". The "Egg" itself, in various symbolic frameworks, represents potential, creation, or new beginnings. Its ambiguous description highlights the game's recurring theme of choice and consequence, where player actions might have unforeseen or subtle impacts rather than immediate, obvious ones. Gaster's offering of this object, an item of uncertain significance, could be a subtle test or influence on the player's choices. It suggests that Gaster is observing or subtly guiding the player's path without directly dictating it, aligning with his role as an experimenter who sets conditions and observes outcomes. The egg's persistent but seemingly useless nature could also imply that some of Gaster's "experiments" or interventions are not immediately impactful but might have long-term, subtle consequences.
            </p>
            <h4>Auditory Echoes</h4>
            <p>
                Gaster's presence is also deeply embedded in the game's sound design:
            </p>
            <p><strong>The "Garbage Noise" from Dark World Phones</strong>: Attempting to use the cell phone in the Dark World consistently produces a distorted, unsettling "garbage noise". Scientific analysis of this sound reveals it to be the mus_st_smile sound file from <em>Undertale</em>, a sound directly associated with Gaster's theme and Entry Number 17. Furthermore, the character Spamton, who was driven to madness, explicitly heard "garbage noise" on his phone during his "communion". The consistent presence of Gaster's associated sound as "garbage noise" whenever communication is attempted in the Dark World, or when characters like Spamton are influenced, strongly implies Gaster's omnipresence and active interference with communication and reality within <em>Deltarune</em>. This suggests he is "listening" and potentially disrupting connections, further solidifying the idea that he is conducting an experiment within <em>Deltarune</em>'s reality.
            </p>
            <p><strong>The Sound Emanating from the Hometown Bunker</strong>: A mysterious bunker located in the south of Hometown emits a strange sound. When this sound is sped up by 666% (a number consistently associated with Gaster), it is revealed to be the same mus_st_smile sound file. The bunker's emission of Gaster's signature sound suggests it is a physical nexus of his influence or a remnant of his past experiments. It is theorized to be <em>Deltarune</em>'s equivalent of <em>Undertale</em>'s "True Laboratory"*, a hidden laboratory or a place where Gaster himself is contained or operating from, bridging the Light and Dark Worlds. This connection implies a physical manifestation of Gaster's influence in the Light World, suggesting his "shattering" allows him to exist in multiple forms or locations. It is poised to be a crucial plot point for future chapters, potentially revealing the true nature of his experiments or providing a direct encounter with him.
            </p>
            <h4>Thematic Parallels and Hidden Data</h4>
            <p>
                Beyond direct appearances and auditory cues, Gaster's influence is woven into the narrative's thematic structure and hidden game data:
            </p>
            <p><strong>Ralsei's Prophecy Echoing "Darker Than Dark"</strong>: Ralsei, a central character, explains the formation of Dark Fountains using phrasing strikingly reminiscent of Entry Number 17, stating that Dark Worlds form when light levels become "darker than dark". The prophecy's echo of Gaster's words implies that Gaster's experiments or knowledge are foundational to the very existence and mechanics of the Dark Worlds and the prophecy itself. If Gaster's "darkness" experiment (Entry 17) is linked to Dark World creation, then the prophecy, which describes the sealing of Dark Fountains, likely stems from Gaster's knowledge or influence. This positions Gaster not just as an experimenter, but potentially as the one who established the very rules or conditions of the <em>Deltarune</em> universe, or at least foresaw its major events.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Dummy Values and Unused Text in Game Files</strong>: Examination of <em>Deltarune</em>'s game files reveals unused text that references the "Mystery Man" sprite's gash and Wingdings handwriting. These texts also speak of "inevitable pain" inflicted upon the player, stating "The pain itself is reason why". These hidden texts, likely originating from Gaster, suggest his awareness of the player's actions and potential suffering, hinting at a more direct, possibly adversarial, role in the future. Gaster's awareness of the player's "crying" and "pain" suggests a deeper, perhaps manipulative, connection. It implies that the player's journey in <em>Deltarune</em> is part of Gaster's larger experiment, and that suffering may be an intended outcome or a necessary component of his research. This raises questions about Gaster's morality and the ethical implications of his grand design.

            <h3>VI. Conclusion: The Unfolding Experiment</h3>
            <p>
                W.D. Gaster transcends his origins as a fragmented secret in <em>Undertale</em> to emerge as a meta-aware, multiversal architect and observer in <em>Deltarune</em>. His "shattering" was not an end but a transformation, granting him the ability to perceive and influence multiple realities. He appears to be orchestrating a grand experiment on the very nature of existence, determination, and player agency within the <em>Deltarune</em> universe. This is evidenced by his direct communication with the player, his profound influence on key characters like Jevil and Spamton, his potential role in shaping the prophecy, and his subtle manipulation of game mechanics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gaster remains an elusive figure, his true motives shrouded in scientific detachment rather than overt malice. However, his influence is undeniable and foundational to <em>Deltarune</em>'s narrative, its overarching themes, and its meta-commentary on the player's role. He functions as the unseen hand, the silent observer, and the orchestrator of an unfolding experiment that challenges the player's perception of control and reality. With the recent release of Chapters 3 and 4, the continued presence of Gaster-related clues and the deepening mystery of the Dark Worlds strongly suggest that his role will become increasingly explicit and crucial as the story progresses towards its conclusion. The eventual opening of the Hometown bunker, a nexus of his influence, and further direct or indirect interactions with characters profoundly affected by him are highly anticipated events that promise to unravel more layers of this complex, interdimensional experiment.
